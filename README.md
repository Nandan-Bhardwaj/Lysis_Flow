# Lysis_Flow


** Lysis Flow ** is designed to help users raise complaints regarding a ticket issued to them. It streamlines the process of complaint tracking, assigning queries to employees, and resolving them efficiently. The system has three roles: Admin, Employees, and Users. It is built using Spring Boot 3.4.x, Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data JPA, Spring Mail Sender, and MySQL.


This project aims to develop a web-based Lysis Flow using Java Spring Boot with Maven. The system consists of multiple modules:

•	**Admin Module:** Manages user complaints, verifies them, assigns resolutions, and updates complaint statuses.

•	**User Module:** Allows users to raise complaints, track their progress, and receive notifications via email.

•	**Ticket Management Module:** Generates unique Ticket IDs, categorizes issues, and maintains complaint records.

•	**Notification Module:** Sends alerts and updates to users via email regarding the status of their complaints.


The backend will be built using Spring Boot, utilizing Spring Security for authentication, JPA/Hibernate for database interactions, and Spring Java Mail for email notifications.
